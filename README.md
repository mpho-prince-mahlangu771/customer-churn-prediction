# Introduction <br>
Businesses have millions of customers using their services on a regular basis. These customers generate revenue for businesses by subscribing to the businesses services. Recently businesses have been loosing customers in the millions. A good example is the cable channel provider DSTV, which lost millions of its subscribers, incurring billions of revenue lossses. It is therefore vital for any business to study reasons their previous customers churned i.e. stopped using their services. <br>

By analysing historical patterns of customers who churned, a business can improve its operations, preventing further churning.
